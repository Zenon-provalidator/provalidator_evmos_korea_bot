{"id":11,"title":"Amend Prematurely-Initiated Decay Period for Claims","desc":"If successful, this parameter-change governance proposal will change `DurationUntilDecay` from \"5616000\" (0.005616 seconds) to \"5616000000000000\" (65 days), amending a previous change which has caused the claims decay period to begin prematurely.\n\nThe original proposer of Proposal #9 made a change thinking the `DurationUntilDecay` period is denominated in seconds, when it should be specified in nanoseconds. This is a reasonable misunderstanding as the network query for this param mistakenly returns a value denominated in seconds, i.e. this query: `evmosd query claims params` previously resulted in a response of: `duration_until_decay: 3801600s`.\n\nThis proposal also serves as an early signal, should the community decide to conduct a coordinated upgrade prior to its full voting period.\n\nOriginal discussion of the proposal that led to this issue: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4744-extend-claims-period-by-21-days","status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED"}
