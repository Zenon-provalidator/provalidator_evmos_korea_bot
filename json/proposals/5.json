{"id":5,"title":"Incentivise Diffusion Usage","desc":"We are requesting Diffusion smart contracts to be whitelisted to get gas subsidies for their users for a period of six months in order to make it easier to onboard users to Evmos.\\n 25% of the Evmos block emission is going toward a pool dedicated to incentivizing users in the form of deferred Gas Rebates.\\nDiffusion is currently the leading DEX on Evmos with a 99% Dominance in liquidity. This will sponsor gas payments for end users when they perform actions like SWAP, STAKE and more on Diffusion. The only constraint is that these incentives have to be less than the fees. Incentives can be up to 120% the total amount of fees burned, so users can end up being paid to use Diffusion. Beware that users will still have to pay for the fees upfront but will get reimbursed each epoch (1 week by default), so they are accumulated and then reimbursed.","status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED"}
